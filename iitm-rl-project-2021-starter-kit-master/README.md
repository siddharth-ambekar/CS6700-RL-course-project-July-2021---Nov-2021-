# üìö Competition procedure

**The following is a high level description of how this process works.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/xzQkwKV.jpg)

1. **Sign up** to join the competition [on the AIcrowd website](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/rl-project-2021).
2. **Clone** this repo and start developing your solution.
3. **Design and build** your agents that can compete in the environments and implement an agent class as described in [writing your agents](#write-your-agents) section.
4. [**Submit**](#-submission) your agents to [AIcrowd Gitlab](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com) for evaluation. [[Refer this for detailed instructions]](#-submission).

# üí™ Getting started

> We recommend using `python 3.8`. If you are using Miniconda/Anaconda, you can install it using `conda install python=3.8`. Recommentded pip version is > 21.1.1

Clone the starter kit repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/siddhartha/iitm-rl-project-2021-starter-kit
cd iitm-rl-project-2021-starter-kit
pip install -U -r requirements.txt

```
   
# üõ† Preparing your submission

## Write your agents

You need to implement the [`Agent`](agent.py#L10) class from [`agent.py`](agent.py). Check out the file for descriptions of the functions that need to be implemented. 

You could specify env specific config options in [`config.py`](config.py)

## Evaluate your agents locally

We have provided [`run.py`](run.py) to test your agents locally.

To run the evaluation locally, run the following commands.

```bash
ENV_NAME="acrobot" python run.py
ENV_NAME="taxi" python run.py
ENV_NAME="kbca" python run.py
ENV_NAME="kbcb" python run.py
ENV_NAME="kbcc" python run.py

```

**Note:** Please note that the changes you make to any file inside [`run.py`](run.py) will be dropped during evaluation. 

# üì® Submission

## Repository structure

**File/Directory** | **Description**
--- | ---
[`agent.py`](agent.py) | File for implementing the Agent class. Your code goes in this file.
[`config.py`](config.py) | File containing the configuration options for  Agent class.
[`run.py`](run.py) | File used to evaluate the agent class. Use this file to test your agents locally
[`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) | File containing the list of python packages you want to install for the submission to run. Refer [runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration) for more information.
[`apt.txt`](apt.txt) | File containing the list of packages you want to install for submission to run. Refer [runtime configuration](#runtime-configuration) for more information.
[`gym-bellman`](gym-bellman/) | Folder containing the gym environment for the Bellman's DP problem
[`docs`](docs/) | Folder containing the descriptions for the environments in the challenge
[`aicrowd.json`](docs/) | Submission configuration


## Runtime configuration

You can specify the list of python packages needed for your code to run in your [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) file. We will install the packages using `pip install` command.

You can also specify the OS packages needed using [`apt.txt`](apt.txt) file. We install these packages using `apt-get install` command.


## üöÄ Submitting to AIcrowd

### **Add your SSH key** to AIcrowd GitLab

You can add your SSH Keys to your GitLab account by going to your profile settings [here](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/profile/keys). If you do not have SSH Keys, you will first need to [generate one](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair).


### `aicrowd.json`

Your repository should have an `aicrowd.json` file with following fields:

```json
{
    "challenge_id" : "rl-project-2021",
    "authors" : ["Your Name"],
    "description" : "Brief description for your submission"
}
```

This file is used to identify your submission as a part of the challenge. You must use the `challenge_id` as specified above.

### Configuring the submission repository

```bash
git remote add aicrowd git@gitlab.aicrowd.com:<username>/iitm-rl-project-2021-starter-kit.git
```

**Note:** This needs to be done only once. This configuration will be saved in your repository for future use.

### Pushing the code to AIcrowd

Create a submission by making a _tag push_ to your repository on [https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/).
**Any tag push (where the tag name begins with "submission-") to your private repository is considered as a submission**  
Then you can add the correct git remote, and finally submit by doing :

```
# Create a tag for your submission and push
git tag -am "submission-v0.1" submission-v0.1
git push aicrowd master
git push aicrowd submission-v0.1

# Note : If the contents of your repository (latest commit hash) does not change,
# then pushing a new tag will **not** trigger a new evaluation.
```

You now should be able to see the details of your submission at :
[gitlab.aicrowd.com/<YOUR_AICROWD_USER_NAME>/iitm-rl-project-2021-starter-kit/issues](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com//<YOUR_AICROWD_USER_NAME>/iitm-rl-project-2021-starter-kit/issues)

**NOTE**: Remember to update your username instead of `<YOUR_AICROWD_USER_NAME>` above :wink:




# üìù Submission checklist

- [x] **Accept the challenge rules**. You can do this by going to the [challenge overview page](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/rl-project-2021) and clicking the "Participate" button. You only need to do this once.
- [x] **Add your agent code** that implements the `Agent` class from `agent.py`.
- [x] **Evaluate your agents locally** to know that they work as expected. Ensure your agent is verified by running `python run.py`.
- [x] **Update runtime configuration** using `requirements.txt`, `apt.txt` as necessary. Please make sure that you specified the same package versions that you use locally on your machine.
